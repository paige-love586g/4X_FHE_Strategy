# 4X Strategy Game with Private Research Trees

Embark on an epic conquest in our 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) strategy game, driven by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**! This innovative game allows you to build civilizations while keeping your technological progress shrouded in secrecy. Opponents won't know your research directions, enabling strategic deception and "black tech" surprises unlike anything seen before.

## The Challenge of Strategy Games

In traditional strategy games, players often face transparency in technological advancements, leading to predictable gameplay and reduced excitement. When everyone knows each other's research paths, the element of surprise—crucial for victory—diminishes significantly. This predictability can stifle creativity and limit strategic possibilities, forcing players to rely on brute force rather than cunning strategy.

## Harnessing FHE for Strategic Depth

Our game introduces an exciting twist with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically utilizing Zama’s open-source libraries. With FHE, your civilization's technology tree advancements are encrypted, meaning your strategies and developments remain confidential. This allows for the introduction of espionage units capable of gathering vague tech intelligence, heightening the strategic privacy of civilization growth and filling each game with uncertainty and intrigue.

## Core Features

- **Encrypted Technology Trees:** Research progress is encrypted, keeping your advancements secret from opposing players.
- **Espionage Units:** Deploy units that can homomorphically gather ambiguous technological intelligence without compromising their safety.
- **Strategic Privacy:** Each player's approach remains hidden, enhancing the depth and unpredictability of every session.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** With the element of surprise reinstated, every match becomes a thrilling game of wits!

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's FHE SDK:** The backbone of our confidential computing.
- **Node.js:** For managing our game server and API.
- **Hardhat:** For Ethereum smart contract development and deployment.
- **Solidity:** Language for writing smart contracts.

## Installation Instructions

To get started, ensure you have the necessary environment set up:

1. **Dependencies:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official website.
2. **Download and extract the project files.** (No `git clone` or URL usage permitted!)
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Building and Running the Game

After successfully installing the necessary packages, you can compile and run the game with the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the Game Server:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/startServer.js
   ```

## Code Example: Utilizing FHE for Technology Research

Here's a simplified example of how you might initiate a technology research action in your game, demonstrating the integration of Zama's FHE:

```javascript
const { encryptResearch } = require('zama-fhe-sdk');

async function startResearch(civilization, technology) {
    const encryptedTech = encryptResearch(technology);
    civilization.research.push(encryptedTech);
    console.log(`${civilization.name} has started researching a new technology!`);
}

// Example usage:
const myCivilization = { name: 'Civilization A', research: [] };
startResearch(myCivilization, 'Advanced Espionage Techniques');
```

This code snippet displays how you can keep your technology research private while still allowing for advancements in gameplay.
